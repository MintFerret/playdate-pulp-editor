# Limitations
- ~**Saving doesn't work (you have to do it manually by exporting your JSON and overwriting it with `games/local/data`)**~
  Not anymore! You can now click on the save button as many times as you want (Still recommended to make backups, just in case)
- Only one game can be edited at once
- Creating and deleting games doesn't work

# Setup
You need to host the source code with a webserver, some browsers may not require a server to run it.
